# MYOB Endless Runner Mini-Game

This is a retro-themed endless runner game built using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript. The game features a 90s pixel art aesthetic and is inspired by classic platformers like Mario and Flappy Bird.

## Prompt Used
- I need a simple endless runner browser game implemented using HTML5 Canvas and vanilla JavaScript with a 90s retro 16-bit pixel art aesthetic, inspired by games like Mario or Flappy Bird.
  The theme is purple and visuals should reflect early 90s arcade games, using pixel art.
- Gameplay Mechanics:
   Continuous side-scrolling from right to left.
   The player auto-runs and can jump with the keyboard (spacebar or arrow up).
   The goal is to collect coins and avoid obstacles/enemies.
   Colliding with enemies ends the game ("Game Over" screen with score).
   Include score tracking, difficulty progression (increasing speed/obstacles over time).

## How to Run the Game
1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd cursor-coding-challenge1
   ```
2. **Start a Local Server**:
   Since the game uses JavaScript and assets, you need a local server to run it. Use the following command:
   ```bash
   python3 -m http.server
   ```
   This will start a local server on port 8000.
3. **Open the Game in a Browser**:
   Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8000
   ```
4. **Play the Game**:
   - Use the `Spacebar` or `Arrow Up` key to jump.
   - Collect coins, avoid enemies, and enjoy the game!
